The code imports the "random" module, which allows the use of random number generation functions.

A random number between 0 and 100 is generated using the "choice()" function from the "random" module, and stored in the variable "random_number".

The code defines two functions, "game()" and "high_low()".

"game()" takes in a user input as a parameter and converts it to an integer. 

The "high_low()" function takes in the "random_number" variable as a parameter and compares it to the user's input.

If the input matches the random number, the function returns "correct". 

If the input is less than the random number, the function prints "too low", and if the input is more than the random number, the function prints "too high".

The code also defines a function "game_mode()" that takes in a string parameter "difficulty" and returns a number based on the difficulty level chosen.

If the difficulty is "simple", the function returns 10, and if the difficulty is "hard", the function returns 5.

The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as the variable "game_on" is set to True. 

The user is prompted to play a game of "high_low" by entering "y" or "n".

If the user enters "y", the code prompts the user to choose a difficulty level, and sets the number of attempts the user has based on the difficulty level chosen.

The code then enters another while loop that continues as long as the number of attempts is greater than 0. 

The user is prompted to input a guess, and the "game()" and "high_low()" functions are called to process the user's input.

The number of attempts is decremented by 1, and the user is informed of the number of attempts left. 

If the "high_low()" function returns "correct", the user wins, and the game ends.

If the number of attempts reaches 0, the user loses and the secret number is revealed.

If the user enters "n", the variable "game_on" is set to False, and the while loop ends, ending the game.
